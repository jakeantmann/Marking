Plan for writing Python code that can control Maxima:

X) Write python code that writes a .mac file
X) Make the .mac file include maxima code
X) Run Maxima with the mac file as input
X) Run Maxima with the mac file as input from an arbitrary location
X) Make Maxima output a txt file
X) Make Maxima output a txt file to a desired location
6) Complete all of that from a python-built txt file

For later: control this information in python to produce TeX files
